esphome的配置文件主要来源于https://github.com/sylvilaurelin/Davis_Vantage_p2plus_EspHome   我的雨量筒规格是美制0.01英寸，我对其中的rain rate计算方式，进行了修改。原作的太阳辐射是直接输出了报告值，我添加了太阳辐射（solar_radiation）的系数，使值与davis控制台一致。

不再需要Davis console ，直接接收 Davis Vantage Pro2 / Vantage Vue EU 868 MHz 户外发射器，使用 ESPHome+ESP32-S3-Zero + CC1101，解码天气数据包，并将测量数据发布到 Home Assistant。

该配置实时遵循戴维斯868 MHz的跳频序列。锁定有效Davis数据包后，ESP32-S3将CC1101重新调谐到下一次传输预期的频率。

> **重要提示:** 该配置适用于欧洲868 MHz Davis系统。它不是美国915 MHz或其他地区版本的直接插入配置。

# Hardware

## Required

- Waveshare ESP32-S3-Zero development board
- CC1101 RF module suitable for the 868 MHz band
- 868 MHz antenna
- 3.3 V power for the CC1101
- Jumper wires or a PCB
<img width="520" height="431" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/1a27c2b1-ce33-4825-9a50-26d04f5eaead" />

A CC1101 module designed for 868/915 MHz operation is recommended.

> **Do not power the CC1101 from 5 V.**  
> Use **3.3 V** power and 3.3 V logic.

### Onboard RGB LED

The Waveshare ESP32-S3-Zero includes a **WS2812 RGB LED on GPIO21**.

In this configuration the LED is used as a **status indicator**:

- **Green** — temperature packet (Type 8)
- **Cyan** — humidity packet (Type 10)
- **Blue** — rain packet (Type 5 or Type 14)
- **Yellow** — solar radiation packet (Type 6)
- **Purple** — UV index packet (Type 4)
- **White** — other valid packets
- **Red** — strong CRC-bad packet inside the expected time window

The LED is declared as an `internal: true` light so it does not appear as a controllable entity in Home Assistant.

# Wiring

The included YAML uses the following ESP32-S3-Zero pins:

| CC1101 pin | ESP32-S3-Zero pin | Function |
|---|---:|---|
| VCC | 3.3 V | Power |
| GND | GND | Ground |
| SCK / CLK | GPIO2 | SPI clock |
| MISO / SO | GPIO3 | SPI MISO |
| MOSI / SI | GPIO1 | SPI MOSI |
| CSN / SS | GPIO4 | Chip select |
| GDO0 | GPIO5 | Packet interrupt / packet-ready signal |
| GDO2 | GPIO6 | Not used by this configuration |

> **Note:** GPIO3 is a strapping pin on the ESP32-S3. It is used here for MISO. This works in practice, but avoid adding external pull-up/pull-down resistors on this pin.

### Wiring diagram

```text
ESP32-S3-Zero                 CC1101
--------------                ------

3.3V  ----------------------> VCC
GND   ----------------------> GND

GPIO2 ----------------------> SCK
GPIO3 <---------------------- MISO / SO
GPIO1 ----------------------> MOSI / SI
GPIO4 ----------------------> CSN / SS
GPIO5 <---------------------- GDO0

                               ANT ---- 868 MHz antenna

Keep the SPI and GDO0 wires reasonably short.

If the CC1101 supply is noisy or the module is unstable, adding local decoupling close to the module can help, for example:

frequency: 868.317250MHz
modulation_type: GFSK
symbol_rate: 19200
fsk_deviation: 9.5kHz
filter_bandwidth: 102kHz
magn_target: 33dB

packet_mode: true
packet_length: 10

sync_mode: 16/16
sync1: 0xCB
sync0: 0x89

crc_enable: false
whitening: false
num_preamble: 2
Important: Some CC1101 breakout boards ship without the local 100 nF decoupling capacitor fitted. If Failed to verify CC1101 appears at boot, check for a missing decoupling capacitor and fit one close to the module's VCC pin.

RF configuration
The working CC1101 settings are:

yaml
frequency: 868.317250MHz
modulation_type: GFSK
symbol_rate: 19200
fsk_deviation: 9.5kHz
filter_bandwidth: 102kHz
magn_target: 33dB

packet_mode: true
packet_length: 10

sync_mode: 16/16
sync1: 0xCB
sync0: 0x89

crc_enable: false
whitening: false
num_preamble: 2
The CC1101 hardware CRC is disabled because the Davis packet uses its own CRC format, which is checked in the ESPHome lambda.

Davis EU frequency hopping
The receiver follows this five-frequency sequence:

Hop	Frequency
0	868.077250 MHz
1	868.317250 MHz
2	868.557250 MHz
3	868.197250 MHz
4	868.437250 MHz
Sequence:

text
868.077250
    ↓
868.317250
    ↓
868.557250
    ↓
868.197250
    ↓
868.437250
    ↓
868.077250
The included YAML initially listens on:

text
868.317250 MHz
Once a CRC-valid packet from the configured Davis transmitter is received, the receiver knows its current hop position and starts following the sequence.

Packet timing
The supplied YAML is configured for:

text
Davis packet Station ID = 0
For this transmitter ID, the packet period is:

text
2.5625 seconds
The ESPHome state machine uses:

text
2563 ms
and re-phases itself whenever a CRC-valid Davis packet is received, preventing timer error from accumulating.

If an expected packet is not received, the watchdog advances to the next hop while keeping the original transmitter timebase.

After 25 consecutive missed transmissions, the receiver abandons its timing lock and returns to the acquisition frequency.

Station ID
The current decoder intentionally accepts only:

cpp
unit_id == 0
This prevents another nearby Davis transmitter from taking over the hopping synchronization.

If your ISS uses another transmitter ID, you must change both:

The accepted unit_id

The packet timing

Nominal packet periods are:

Packet Station ID	Period
0	2.5625 s
1	2.6250 s
2	2.6875 s
3	2.7500 s
4	2.8125 s
5	2.8750 s
6	2.9375 s
7	3.0000 s
The current YAML has the 2563 ms value in both the successful-packet re-phase logic and missed-packet watchdog. Both values must be changed for another transmitter ID.

Decoded packet types
The current decoder handles the following Davis packet types:

Type	Measurement
4	UV index
5	Rain rate / seconds between bucket tips
6	Solar radiation
8	Outdoor temperature
9	Wind gust
10	Outdoor humidity
14	Rain bucket tip counter
Wind speed and wind direction are carried in the common portion of valid packets and are therefore updated much more frequently than when listening on only one fixed RF channel.

Solar radiation calibration
The Davis Type 6 packet carries a 10-bit ADC value, not a direct W/m² value. The raw value must be multiplied by a calibration factor:

text
solar_W_m2 = raw_10bit * 1.757936
This factor is taken from the DavisRFM69 example decoder and matches the value shown on the Davis console.

Home Assistant entities
The YAML creates these main entities:

Entity name	Description
Davis Temperature	Outdoor temperature
Davis Humidity	Outdoor humidity
Davis Wind Speed	Wind speed
Davis Wind Gust	Wind gust
Davis Wind Direction	Degrees + compass direction
Davis Solar Radiation	Solar radiation
Davis UV Index	UV index
Davis Daily Rain	Rain accumulator since ESP boot
Davis Rain Rate	Instantaneous tipping-bucket rain rate in mm/h
Davis Battery Low	ISS battery-low flag
Davis RSSI	RF signal strength
Davis LQI	CC1101 link-quality indicator
The Status LED entity is internal: true and is not exposed to Home Assistant.

Rain rate (Type 5)
Davis packet Type 5 carries the timing used to derive instantaneous tipping-bucket rain rate.

The decoder reconstructs the number of seconds between / since bucket tips from bytes 3 and 4. For the metric Davis 0.2 mm tipping bucket:

text
rain_rate_mm_h = 720 / rain_seconds
Examples:

Tip interval	Rain rate
30 s	24.00 mm/h
60 s	12.00 mm/h
120 s	6.00 mm/h
300 s	2.40 mm/h
600 s	1.20 mm/h
900 s	0.80 mm/h
>= 1020 s	0.00 mm/h
The resulting Home Assistant entity is:

text
sensor.davis_rain_rate
This is an instantaneous/extrapolated tipping-bucket rate, not a rolling hourly rainfall total. Type 14 remains the source for accumulated rainfall.

Important note about rain
The current entity is named:

text
Davis Daily Rain
but the ESPHome implementation itself is currently a running accumulator since ESP boot.

The global is initialized as:

yaml
- id: rain_total_mm
  type: float
  initial_value: '0.0'
It is not persisted across reboot and there is no midnight reset in the YAML.

For a true calendar-day rainfall total, create a Home Assistant Utility Meter from sensor.davis_daily_rain with a daily cycle and periodically_resetting: true:

yaml
utility_meter:
  davis_rain_today:
    source: sensor.davis_daily_rain
    name: Davis Rain Today
    cycle: daily
    periodically_resetting: true
    always_available: true
For a true daily rainfall value, it is recommended to either:

create the daily total in Home Assistant from a monotonic rain counter, or

add persistence and a daily reset strategy to the ESPHome configuration.

The decoder currently assumes:

text
1 bucket tip = 0.2 mm
and uses the rolling 7-bit Davis rain-tip counter.

Reception statistics
Every 60 seconds the YAML logs per-hop diagnostics.

Example:

text
DAVIS_STATS:
H0 868.077271 | 60s ok 5/5 100% crc 0 miss 0
H1 868.317261 | 60s ok 5/5 100% crc 0 miss 0
H2 868.557251 | 60s ok 5/5 100% crc 0 miss 0
H3 868.197266 | 60s ok 5/5 100% crc 0 miss 0
H4 868.437256 | 60s ok 5/5 100% crc 0 miss 0
ALL | 60s ok 25/25 100.0% crc 0 miss 0
Meanings:

ok — CRC-valid Davis packet

crc — strong, time-plausible packet that failed Davis CRC

miss — no usable packet was received in the expected slot

The statistics also include cumulative counts since boot.

These diagnostics are especially useful for checking:

antenna placement

individual hopping frequencies

interference

marginal CC1101 modules

receiver placement

Installing
1. Copy the YAML
Use the supplied ESPHome YAML as the device configuration.

Before publishing or installing it on another device, change at least:

yaml
esphome:
  name: your-davis-receiver
  friendly_name: Davis Receiver
The original YAML contains installation-specific names.

2. Create secrets.yaml
At minimum, the configuration expects secrets for Wi-Fi, API encryption and OTA.

Example:

yaml
wifi_ssid: "YOUR_WIFI_NAME"
wifi_password: "YOUR_WIFI_PASSWORD"

esphome_web_4763f4__encryption_key: "YOUR_ESPHOME_API_KEY"
OTA_password: "YOUR_OTA_PASSWORD"
You may also rename the API encryption secret in the main YAML to something more generic before publishing.

3. Compile and upload
Compile the configuration with ESPHome and upload it to the ESP32-S3-Zero.

After the first USB installation, OTA updates can be used.

4. Watch the logs
On startup, the receiver waits on the acquisition frequency until it receives a CRC-valid Station ID 0 packet.

A successful lock looks similar to:

text
DAVIS_HOP: LOCKED on hop 1; following Davis EU sequence
After locking, valid packets should normally appear approximately every:

text
2.5625 seconds
The per-hop statistics begin reporting every 60 seconds.

If the CC1101 reports Failed to verify CC1101 at boot but valid Davis packets are still received afterwards, check the CC1101 decoupling capacitor and SPI wiring. This warning is usually benign if packets are decoded correctly.

Optional ESPHome features
The supplied YAML also contains:

yaml
bluetooth_proxy:
  active: true

web_server:
  port: 80
Neither is required for Davis reception.

They can be removed if you want a smaller, dedicated weather receiver configuration.

Troubleshooting
No packets at all
Check:

CC1101 is an 868/915 MHz version

CC1101 is powered from 3.3 V

SPI wiring is correct

SPI pins are CLK=GPIO2, MISO=GPIO3, MOSI=GPIO1

CSN is on GPIO4

GDO0 is on GPIO5

antenna is suitable for 868 MHz

Davis system is the EU 868 MHz model

Davis transmitter Station ID is 0

Receives only every ~12.8 seconds
That usually means the receiver is effectively hearing only one of the five Davis hopping frequencies.

A correctly synchronized Station ID 0 receiver should normally see a transmission about every 2.5625 seconds.

Good RSSI but many bad packets
Verify the RF parameters, especially:

yaml
fsk_deviation: 9.5kHz
filter_bandwidth: 102kHz
magn_target: 33dB
packet_length: 10
sync_mode: 16/16
Also check the antenna and power supply.

Frequent loss of hopping synchronization
Use the DAVIS_STATS output to determine whether the problem is:

one specific hop frequency

CRC failures

complete misses

RF signal strength

interference

Do not tune the frequencies based only on RSSI. CRC-valid reception percentage is the more useful metric.

LED does not light up
If the onboard WS2812 LED does not light up:

Confirm the LED is declared with pin: GPIO21 and channel_colors: GRB.

Confirm the LED is declared as internal: true so it does not conflict with Home Assistant control.

Confirm the script: block is present and uses the lambda-based set_rgb() API.

Test the LED in isolation with a minimal configuration before adding the CC1101 back.

On Waveshare ESP32-S3-Zero boards, check whether the board has a hardware jumper for the RGB LED.

Notes about the 10-byte Davis packet
The CC1101 is configured to receive a fixed 10-byte packet.

The decoder uses the first eight bytes for the primary weather payload and CRC. Bytes 8 and 9 are retained so bit-alignment recovery has access to the complete received data and so direct-ISS/repeater framing can be diagnosed.

For the direct ISS used during development, valid packets normally had:

text
FF FF
in the final two decoded bytes.

The YAML logs a warning if a CRC-valid packet has a different tail.

Antenna notes
A simple 868 MHz quarter-wave wire is approximately:

text
86 mm
A half-wave dipole is approximately:

text
2 × 86 mm
after allowing for real-world construction and tuning.

For best results:

keep the antenna away from large metal surfaces

avoid placing the ESP32-S3-Zero/CC1101 inside a closed steel enclosure

orient the antenna appropriately for the Davis transmitter

use short coax if the antenna must be moved away from electronics

do not place the antenna directly next to the ESP32-S3-Zero Wi-Fi antenna

The exact best orientation depends on the installation.

Current limitations
EU 868 MHz frequency set only

Station ID 0 only unless timing/code is changed

Rain total resets when the ESP reboots

No automatic midnight rain reset

No support yet for multiple Davis transmitters

Repeater behavior has not been extensively tested

This is a reverse-engineered receiver and is not an official Davis Instruments implementation
